abstract: 'Drawing on the legacies of its traditional humanistic domains of origin, the Digital Humanities have inherited many of their structures - despite the DH’s self-understanding as “revolutionary”. At our panel we want to approach the theme of the conference (“Collaboration as Opportunity”, especially the call for “Revolutions”: https://dh2023.adho.org/?page_id=310) from an international, multimodal perspective, informed by the discourse about cultural criticism in DH. We would like to interrogate areas in the ‘borderlands’ (Earhart 2018) of the field as areas where the DH still have the potential for revolutions. In our panel, we hope to shed light on blind spots in the DH such as monolingualism (Fiormonte 2021), a heritage of colonialism (Risam 2019) and gender imbalance (Gao et al. 2022, 330), to name but a few.'
summary: 'The panel "Exploring the Borderlands: A Revolutionary Potential for DH" was convened as part of the ADHO Digital Humanities Conference 2023 in Graz. The panel sought to interrogate and deconstruct the self-ascribed "revolutionary" ethos of Digital Humanities (DH), particularly in the context of the broader theme of the conference, "Collaboration as Opportunity," with a special focus on "Revolutions". Grounded in international, multimodal perspectives and informed by the discourse on cultural criticism in DH, the panelists examined the latent areas for revolution within ’borderlands’ of the field (Earhart 2018).'
