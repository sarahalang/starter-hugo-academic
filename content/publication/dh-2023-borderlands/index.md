abstract: 'The panel "Exploring the Borderlands: A Revolutionary Potential for DH" was convened as part of the ADHO Digital Humanities Conference 2023 in Graz. The panel sought to interrogate and deconstruct the self-ascribed "revolutionary" ethos of Digital Humanities (DH), particularly in the context of the broader theme of the conference, "Collaboration as Opportunity," with a special focus on "Revolutions". Grounded in international, multimodal perspectives and informed by the discourse on cultural criticism in DH, the panelists examined the latent areas for revolution within ’borderlands’ of the field (Earhart 2018).'
